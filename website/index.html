            Going Nuts! is a 3D, arcade style game where nuts rule. You play as Huey, a squirrel who's life collection of acorns all fell down a chasm during an earthquake.
            It is up to you to lead Huey down the depths of the earth to retrieve his nuts. This game is a fast paced puzzle platformer with multiple levels that will keep
            you coming back for more. Each new level introduces a new type of obstacle that will stand in Huey's way, or a power up that will aid him in his quest. This game is
            addicting to the core!
